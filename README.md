##What's this, then?
Design style tiles with SCSS! Unchain your design ideas from Photoshop and jump straight into code. Create an additional site on your NationBuilder nation and set this as the custom theme. It's responsive, too. 

##A brief explanation
Start at the top of the SCSS for the most basic options, and move down for more fine-grained styling. (For simplicity, the SCSS is all kept in a single file. If you'd prefer to use partials, that works too.)

The SCSS is sectioned into (from top -> bottom):
- Basic styling
  - Main colors, basic typography, textures, and button styling.
- Advanced styling
  - Advanced options for the above items. If you want to make fancy buttons, do cool things with the texture boxes, or have fine-grained control over the typography samples and adjectives, do it here.
- Settings
- Below the settings, everything comes together in the proper order to be compiled.

Play around! Use SCSS and Compass's colour functions to create colour schemes, try to do fancy stuff in the texture boxes, mess about with floats and margins to customize the layout -- make it your own.

##Compass
Style Tiles with SCSS is set up for use with Compass (http://compass-style.org), but does not require it.

###Forked from Jerad Gallinger
This Style Tiles repo was originally forked from Jerad Gallinger (https://github.com/ianpatrickhines/style-tiles-with-scss). It’s now in it’s own repository because I’ve repackaged it as a functional NationBuilder theme.
